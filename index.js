// Given an array of integers find a sequence with the largest sum.

// Use it as a mechanism to focus on process. 
// Think about this problem as a practice in breaking down problems, and knowing when to retreat from a potential solution.
// A couple of leading questions that might help you get started:

// What are some examples of input arrays where the solution becomes obvious? What can you learn from those obvious cases?
// What would a naive solution look like, that tested every possible combination?

// Challenge - Time Complexity
// After you've implemented a basic solution, consider how many operations it will use to find an answer, based on the size of the input array. If you can, write down the Big O time complexity of your solution.

// How could you make your solution faster? Try to improve your solution's runtime, or explain why you think your solution is as fast as possible.
